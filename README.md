# theBored

## Abstract
theBored is an activity generator application built utilizing React, Router, and Material UI. Cypress end to end testing was used on DOM elements and content to test the user experience of the application.

#### Goals and Objectives
- Build a React/ Router application to hone my skills
- Utilize Cypress for testing of our content and DOM items for happy and sad paths
- Executed newly learned, Material UI, for using pre-built components.
- Refine Git workflow and time/task management behaviours
- Implement using User Persona

## Features
- App was built up using MUI components inside a React application frame
- A user can visit the page to see a random activity
- New activities can be called with a button click
- Activities can be saved to and deleted from the Board
- App background on the Welcome page
- Deployed and accessible anywhere via vercel

## Possible Future Extensions
- User Logins
- User can add/post activities
- GSAP animations
- Progress monitor on activities

#### Milestones
- After recently learned MUI, was able to implement it with my solo project with much more understanding.


#### Challenges 
- MUI styling isn't as straight forward with all of its components.
- Using the theme plug-in with MUI to style everything
- Initially was using axios in handling my apicall but it was forcing the url request with an http.  Was rendering the deployed page as blank.
